Time-Locked Social Recovery Wallet with Guardian Reputation System

📝 Project Description
This project is a smart contract wallet that empowers secure, decentralized ownership recovery through a network of trusted guardians. It blends time-locked recovery flows with a guardian reputation mechanism to minimize abuse, support lost key scenarios, and improve the resilience of crypto self-custod
🌍 Project Vision
To build a trustless, resilient, and community-driven wallet recovery mechanism that eliminates single points of failure and enhances the safety of digital assets in the decentralized world. The vision is to offer individuals the ability to regain control over their wallets without relying on centralized institutions, while discouraging malicious actors through a reputation and staking system.

✨ Key Features
🔒 Time-Locked Recovery: Different delays based on the recovery scenario:

LOST_KEY: 7-day waiting period

COMPROMISED: 1-day waiting period

EMERGENCY: Immediate if majority is met

👥 Guardian-Based Social Recove

Recovery requires consensus by a group of trusted guardians.

Weighted voting based on guardian reputation.

⭐ Guardian Reputation System:

Reputation increases with successful recoveries.

Penalties applied to dishonest or failed actions.

💰 Staking Mechanism:

Guardians must stake ETH to vote.

Successful votes earn a reward.

Failed/malicious votes lose the stake.

📈 Dynamic Voting:

Voting power is proportional to reputation, not equal for all.

🛡️ Decentralized Ownership Transfer:

No single point of control or recovery authority.

🚀 Future Scope
✅ Guardian Off-Chain Authentication:

Integrate with zk-proofs or social identity providers to verify guardianship securely.

📱 Frontend DApp UI:

Build an intuitive React-based interface for users to manage wallets and recovery flows easily.

🔌 Chain-Agnostic Support:

Extend to work on multiple EVM-compatible chains.

🧠 AI/ML Reputation Scoring (Experimental):

Use data-driven models to evolve guardian reputation scoring.

🔒 Multisig Guardian Enhancements:

Add support for multi-signature guardian collectives.

📜 Integration with DAO Governance:

Allow communities/DAOs to help recover wallets for their members via on-chain voting.
